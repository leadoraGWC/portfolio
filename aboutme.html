<p><b>Hi, my name is Leadora Kyin. I am 17 years old. My hobbies include swimming, drawing, and traveling. I also like to pretend that I'm good at dancing and singing. I have a chihuahua named Sammy. I am currently in Girls Who Code. I think that HTML is really hard and it is taking a really long time to make this website. I don't binge watch TV shows, but when I do, I watch Cupcake Wars or Chopped. I like swimming, art, photography, traveling, museums, stationery, eating, the color orange, and animals. I dislike (raw) tomatoes, physics, and the college admission process.</b></p>
